# CryptoVisualizer
# Error reason
The app is ready full-fledged. But the error is due to the FileNotFoundError. We are unable to add the sample data file in this github repo because github can take a file which does not exceed 25MB but the data file is more than 350MB. Hence, that leads to the FileNotFoundError.
